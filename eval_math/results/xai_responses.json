When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

The walking time is distance divided by speed. For the first scenario: walking time = 9 / s hours, and total time = 4 hours, so 9 / s + (t / 60) = 4 (since t minutes = t/60 hours).\n\n3) For the second scenario: walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours, and total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours, so 9 / (s + 2) + (t / 60) = 2.4.\n\n4) Now solve the system of equations.
