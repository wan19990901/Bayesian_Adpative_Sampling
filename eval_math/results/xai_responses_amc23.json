      "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) Alicia and Beth are biking towards each other from cities A and B, which are 45 miles apart. Since they are moving in opposite directions towards each other, their speeds combine to close the distance faster. Alicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, and Beth's speed is 12 miles per hour, so the combined speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\n\n2) To find the time it takes for them to meet, divide the total distance between the cities by their combined speed. Time = Distance / Speed = 45 miles / 30 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\n\n3) Now, calculate how far Alicia has traveled in that time. Alicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, and she has been biking for 1.5 hours, so the distance she travels is Speed \u00d7 Time = 18 miles per hour \u00d7 1.5 hours = 27 miles.\n\n4) This distance represents how far Alicia has biked from City A, which is where they meet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 27.",
      "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, recognize that Alicia and Beth are biking towards each other, so their speeds add up to determine how quickly the distance between them is closing. Alicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, and Beth's speed is 12 miles per hour. Therefore, their relative speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\n\n2) The total distance between City A and City B is 45 miles. To find the time it takes for them to meet, divide the total distance by their relative speed: Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 45 miles / 30 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\n\n3) In that time, Alicia has been biking towards City B at 18 miles per hour. So, the distance Alicia covers is calculated by multiplying her speed by the time: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 18 miles per hour \u00d7 1.5 hours = 27 miles.\n\n4) This distance represents how far Alicia has traveled from City A when they meet. Therefore, they meet 27 miles from City A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 27.",

The problem states that the weight of 1/3 of a large pizza plus 3 1/2 cups of orange slices equals the weight of 3/4 of a large pizza plus 1/2 cup of orange slices. First, convert 3 1/2 cups to an improper fraction: 3 1/2 = 7/2 cups. The weight of the orange slices is then: (7/2 cups) \u00d7 (1/4 pound/cup) = 7/8 pounds for the first part, and (1/2 cup) \u00d7 (1/4 pound/cup) = 1/8 pound for the second part.\n\n2) Set up the equation based on the problem: (1/3 P) + 7/8 = (3/4 P) + 1/8.\n\n3) Subtract (1/3 P) from both sides to get: 7/8 = (3/4 P) - (1/3 P) + 1/8.\n\n4) Subtract 1/8 from both sides: 7/8 - 1/8 = (3/4 P) - (1/3 P), which simplifies to 6/8 = (3/4 P) - (1/3 P). Simplify 6/8 to 3/4: 3/4 = (3/4 P) - (1/3 P).\n\n5) To combine the P terms, find a common denominator for 3/4 and 1/3, which is 12: (3/4 P) = (9/12 P) and (1/3 P) = (4/12 P). So, 3/4 = (9/12 P) - (4/12 P) = (5/12 P).\n\n6) Solve for P by multiplying both sides by 12/5: P = (3/4) \u00d7 (12/5) = (3 \u00d7 12) / (4 \u00d7 5) = 36/20.

For example, when k=8, 25 \u00d7 8^2 = 25 \u00d7 64 = 1600, which is less than 2023. When k=9, 25 \u00d7 9^2 = 25 \u00d7 81 = 2025, which is greater than 2023.

Solving for x gives 8x = 20y, so x = (5/2)y.  \n   Substitute x = (5/2)y into the first equation: [(5/2)y]^2 - 8*(5/2)y + y^2 = 0, which is (25/4)y^2 - 20y + y^2 = 0. Combine terms: (25/4)y^2 + (4/4)y^2 - 20y = 0, so (29/4)y^2 - 20y = 0. Multiply through by 4: 29y^2 - 80y = 0, so y(29y - 80) = 0. Thus, y = 0 or y = 80/29.  \n   If y = 0, then x = (5/2)(0) = 0, giving the point (0,0). If y = 80/29, then x = (5/2)(80/29) = 200/29, giving the point (200/29, 80/29).

      "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) The sides of triangle ABC are in arithmetic progression with the smallest side being 6. Let the sides be 6, b, and c, where c is the largest side, and they satisfy the arithmetic progression condition: 2b = 6 + c.\n\n2) The angle of 120\u00b0 is the largest angle, so it is opposite the largest side c. Using the law of cosines: c\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 b \u00d7 cos(120\u00b0). Since cos(120\u00b0) = -1/2, this simplifies to c\u00b2 = 36 + b\u00b2 + 6b.\n\n3) Substitute c from the arithmetic progression: c = 2b - 6. So, (2b - 6)\u00b2 = 36 + b\u00b2 + 6b.\n\n4) Expand the equation: (2b - 6)\u00b2 = 4b\u00b2 - 24b + 36. Now, 4b\u00b2 - 24b + 36 = 36 + b\u00b2 + 6b.\n\n5) Simplify: 4b\u00b2 - 24b + 36 - 36 - b\u00b2 - 6b = 0 \u2192 3b\u00b2 - 30b = 0 \u2192 3b(b - 10) = 0. So, b = 10 (since b > 0).\n\n6) Find c: c = 2(10) - 6 = 14. The sides are 6, 10, and 14.\n\n7) The area of the triangle can be found using the formula: Area = (1/2) \u00d7 side1 \u00d7 side2 \u00d7 sin(included angle).

Since 25 and 169 have no common factors other than 1 (25 = 5^2 and 169 = 13^2), they are relatively prime.\n\n9) The ratio is 25/169, so m = 25 and n = 169.

Simplifying this fraction: 6.25 = 25/4 and 42.25 = 169/4, so the ratio is (25/4) / (169/4) = (25/4) \u00d7 (4/169) = 25/169.\n\n6) The fraction 25/169 is already in simplest terms because 25 and 169 have no common factors other than 1 (25 = 5\u00b2 and 169 = 13\u00b2). Thus, m = 25 and n = 169, so m + n = 25 + 169 = 194.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 194.",
      "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) Recognize that for a right triangle inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. For the 3-4-5 right triangle inscribed in circle A, the hypotenuse is 5, so the diameter of circle A is 5 units. For the 5-12-13 right triangle inscribed in circle B, the hypotenuse is 13, so the diameter of circle B is 13 units.\n\n2) Calculate the radius of each circle. The radius is half of the diameter. For circle A, radius r_A = 5 / 2 = 2.5 units. For circle B, radius r_B = 13 / 2 = 6.5 units.\n\n3) Compute the area of each circle using the formula for the area of a circle, Area = \u03c0 r\u00b2. For circle A, Area_A = \u03c0 (r_A)\u00b2 = \u03c0 (2.5)\u00b2 = \u03c0 (6.25). To keep it exact, 2.5 is 5/2, so Area_A = \u03c0 (5/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 (25/4). For circle B, Area_B = \u03c0 (r_B)\u00b2 = \u03c0 (6.5)\u00b2 = \u03c0 (42.25). To keep it exact, 6.5 is 13/2, so Area_B = \u03c0 (13/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 (169/4).\n\n4) Find the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B: Ratio = Area_A / Area_B = [\u03c0 (25/4)] / [\u03c0 (169/4)]. The \u03c0 terms cancel out, and the 4 in the denominator of the numerator cancels with the 4 in the denominator of the denominator: Ratio = (25/4) \u00f7 (169/4) = (25/4) \u00d7 (4/169) = 25/169.\n\n5) Express the ratio as a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Here, 25/169 is already in simplest terms because 25 (which is 5\u00b2) and 169 (which is 13\u00b2) have no common factors other than 1 (since 5 and 13 are distinct primes). So, m = 25 and n = 169. Now, compute m + n = 25 + 169 = 194.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 194.",

Therefore, the radius of circle B is 13/2 = 6.5 units.\n\n3) The area of a circle is given by the formula \u03c0r\u00b2. So, the area of circle A is \u03c0 \u00d7 (2.5)\u00b2 = \u03c0 \u00d7 6.25 square units, and the area of circle B is \u03c0 \u00d7 (6.5)\u00b2 = \u03c0 \u00d7 42.25 square units.\n\n4) The ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B is (\u03c0 \u00d7 6.25) / (\u03c0 \u00d7 42.25) = 6.25 / 42.25.
