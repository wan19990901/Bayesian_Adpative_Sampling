      "Let me solve this step by step:\n1) First, let's determine the combined speed at which Alicia and Beth are closing the distance between them. Since they are biking towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n   - Alicia's speed: 18 miles per hour\n   - Beth's speed: 12 miles per hour\n   - Combined speed: 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour\n\n2) Next, we need to find out how long it takes for them to meet. Since the total distance between the two cities is 45 miles, and they are closing the distance at a combined speed of 30 miles per hour, we can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the total distance by their combined speed.\n   - Total distance: 45 miles\n   - Combined speed: 30 miles per hour\n   - Time to meet: 45 \u00f7 30 = 1.5 hours\n\n3) Now that we know it takes 1.5 hours for them to meet, we can calculate how far Alicia has traveled in that time.

      "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) Let the number of left-handed players be \\(L\\). Then the number of right-handed players is \\(2L\\).\n2) The total number of participants is \\(L + 2L = 3L\\).\n3) In a round-robin tournament where each player plays every other player exactly once, the total number of games played is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of players. So, the total number of games played is \\(\\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}\\).\n\n4) Let the number of games won by right-handed players be \\(R\\). Then the number of games won by left-handed players is \\(1.4R\\).\n5) We need to express the total number of games won in terms of \\(L\\). Each game results in one win, so the total number of games won is equal to the total number of games played, which is \\(\\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}\\).\n\n6) The number of games won by right-handed players \\(R\\) can be written as the sum of games won by right-handed players against each other plus games won by right-handed players against left-handed players. The number of games between right-handed players is \\(\\frac{2L(2L-1)}{2} = L(2L-1)\\), and the number of games between right-handed and left-handed players is \\(L \\times 2L = 2L^2\\). So, \\(R = L(2L-1) + x\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of games won by right-handed players against left-handed players.\n\n7) The number of games won by left-handed players is \\(1.4R\\), and they play \\(2L^2\\) games in total. Let \\(y\\) be the number of games won by left-handed players against right-handed players, and the number of games won by left-handed players against each other is \\(\\frac{L(L-1)}{2}\\). So, \\(1.4R = \\frac{L(L-1)}{2} + y\\).\n\n8) Since the total number of games won is the total number of games played, we have:\n   \\[\n   R + 1.4R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\implies 2.4R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\implies R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8} = \\frac{5L(3L-1)}{8}\n   \\]\n9) Since \\(R = L(2L-1) + x\\), and \\(1.4R = \\frac{L(L-1)}{2} + y\\), we can substitute \\(R\\) and solve for \\(L\\).

      "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) Define the number of left-handed players as \\( L \\). Then the number of right-handed players is \\( 2L \\) since there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players.\n\n2) The total number of players is \\( L + 2L = 3L \\).\n\n3) The total number of games played in the tournament is the number of ways to choose 2 players out of \\( 3L \\) players, which is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} \\).\n\n4) Let \\( W_R \\) be the number of games won by right-handed players and \\( W_L \\) be the number of games won by left-handed players. According to the problem, \\( W_L = 1.4W_R \\).\n\n5) Each game is played between one left-handed and one right-handed player. Since there are no ties, the total number of games \\( G \\) is also the sum of games won by right-handed players and left-handed players, i.e., \\( G = W_R + W_L \\).\n\n6) From step 4, we have \\( W_L = 1.4W_R \\). Substituting this into the equation for the total number of games: \\( G = W_R + 1.4W_R = 2.4W_R \\). Therefore, \\( W_R = \\frac{G}{2.4} \\) and \\( W_L = 1.4 \\cdot \\frac{G}{2.4} = \\frac{1.4G}{2.4} = \\frac{7G}{12} \\).\n\n7) Each game is played between one left-handed and one right-handed player, so the total number of games \\( G \\) is also the total number of matches between left-handed and right-handed players. Since there are \\( L \\) left-handed players and \\( 2L \\) right-handed players, the total number of such matches is \\( L \\cdot 2L = 2L^2 \\). Hence, \\( G = 2L^2 \\).\n\n8) From step 6, we also have \\( G = 2.4W_R \\). Since \\( W_R \\) is the number of games won by right-handed players, and each game involves one right-handed player, the number of games won by right-handed players \\( W_R \\) is at most \\( 2L^2 \\) (since each right-handed player can win at most one game per left-handed player).\n\n9) Combining the equations from steps 7 and 8, we get \\( 2L^2 = 2.4W_R \\). Since \\( W_R \\) is an integer, \\( 2L^2 \\) must be divisible by 2.4. Simplifying, we get \\( L^2 = 1.2W_R \\). Therefore, \\( L^2 \\) must be an integer, and \\( W_R \\) must be a multiple of 5 (since 1.2 = 6/5).\n\n10) Testing integer values for \\( L \\) and checking the divisibility:\n    - If \\( L = 5 \\), then \\( L^2 = 25 \\) and \\( W_R = \\frac{25}{1.2} = \\frac{250}{12} = \\frac{125}{6} \\) (not an integer).\n    - If \\( L = 10 \\), then \\( L^2 = 100 \\) and \\( W_R = \\frac{100}{1.2} = \\frac{1000}{12} = \\frac{250}{3} \\) (not an integer).\n    - If \\( L = 15 \\), then \\( L^2 = 225 \\) and \\( W_R = \\frac{225}{1.2} = \\frac{2250}{12} = 187.5 \\) (not an integer).\n    - If \\( L = 20 \\), then \\( L^2 = 400 \\) and \\( W_R = \\frac{400}{1.2} = \\frac{4000}{12} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\) (not an integer).\n    - If \\( L = 25 \\), then \\( L^2 = 625 \\) and \\( W_R = \\frac{625}{1.2} = \\frac{6250}{12} = 520.8333 \\) (not an integer).\n    - If \\( L = 12 \\), then \\( L^2 = 144 \\) and \\( W_R = \\frac{144}{1.2} = 120 \\) (an integer).\n\n11) Therefore, \\( L = 12 \\) and \\( 2L = 24 \\). The total number of players is \\( 3L = 36 \\) and the total number of games is \\( 2L^2 = 2 \\cdot 144 = 288 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of games played is 288.",

Solving for \\( G_R \\) gives \\( G_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8} \\).\n\n6) Since \\( G_R \\) and \\( G_L \\) must be integers, the numerator \\( 3L(3L-1) \\) must be divisible by 4.8, which means it must be divisible by 24, because 4.8 in its simplest form is \\( \\frac{24}{5} \\).\n\n7) Let's test small values of \\( L \\) to find the smallest \\( L \\) that satisfies the condition.
